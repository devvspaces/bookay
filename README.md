## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

The problem is that there is no online platform to buy books in Nigeria. The stress of getting books from outside the country is too much.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Bookay is a platform for techies in Nigeria to buy technical books and sell used ones. It's an online bookshop. Store owners can sell their books on the platform. Any one is able to sell their books on the platform. You can also buy books from the platform. With Bookay, you can buy books from the comfort of your home. You can also sell your books and make money.

Using Xata full text search api, Bookay can help you find the book you want to buy. You can also search for books by title, author, publisher, ISBN, etc. all in one place, a single search box.

It's a 100% Jamstack product. It's built it NextJs. 

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Xata: full text search api to search for books & Database.
- Cloudinary: for image storage, delivery and transformation.

Limitation: No payment system is added yet. This hackathon gave me the opportunity to build a product from scratch. It was a great experience. I learnt a lot. I will add a payment system to the product in the future.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- Add a payment system.
- Add an pre-order system. So that users can pre-order books that are not yet available.
- Add a rating and review system. So that users can rate and review books sellers.
- Securing app with a better authentication system like NextAuth.
- Add a chat system so that users can chat with sellers.
